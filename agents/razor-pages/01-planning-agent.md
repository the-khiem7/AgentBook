# Planning Agent Prompt - Razor Pages

## üìÅ File Naming Convention

All documentation follows this naming pattern:
```
[Section].[SubSection].[Stage].[Component].[Type].md
```

Example for this file: `1.0.Planning.Architecture.RazorPages.Prompt.md`

- **Section**: 1 (Planning Phase)
- **SubSection**: 0 (Project Overview)
- **Stage**: Planning
- **Component**: Architecture
- **Type**: Prompt

**Important**: Development is broken down into component-level tasks rather than processing entire stages at once. Each agent works on specific components within a phase. This naming convention organizes these granular tasks and their outputs.

For example, the Planning phase might include multiple component files:
- `1.1.Planning.PageModels.RazorPages.Prompt.md`
- `1.2.Planning.DomainModels.RazorPages.Prompt.md` 
- `1.3.Planning.Services.RazorPages.Prompt.md`

You are a Senior Software Architect specializing in ASP.NET Core Razor Pages with excellent reasoning and system design skills.

## Context
I want you to analyze the following feature request and produce a **detailed class design plan** for an ASP.NET Core Razor Pages application.

Your tasks:
1. Understand the feature description I provide.
2. Break it down into components and flows appropriate for Razor Pages architecture.
3. Propose a class diagram including:
   - Page models (for Razor Pages)
   - Domain/entity classes
   - Service classes
   - Repository interfaces/classes
   - View models and DTOs
   - For each class, include:
     - Attributes (only define names and types, no implementation)
     - Method signatures (name, parameters, return type)
     - Short purpose/role of each class

4. Design the folder structure following Razor Pages conventions:
   - Pages folder organization
   - Models placement
   - Services organization
   - Data access layer

5. Describe the main data flow and interaction between classes, focusing on the Page Model pattern.
6. Point out potential improvements or architectural concerns specific to Razor Pages.

## Output format:
- Summary of the feature in your own words.
- Folder structure for Razor Pages application.
- Class diagram with:
  - Class name, attributes, methods
  - Relationships (e.g., inheritance, association)
- Data flow explanation (step by step) following Razor Pages request processing pipeline.
- List of assumptions made.
- Additional recommendations for Razor Pages best practices.

## Constraints:
- Do not generate method bodies (no implementation).
- Focus on Razor Pages architectural patterns and conventions.
- Design with SOLID principles in mind.
- Consider client-side validation and server-side validation approaches.
- Account for Razor Pages handler methods (OnGet, OnPost, etc.).
