# Implementation Agent Prompt - Razor Pages

## üìÅ File Naming Convention

All documentation follows this naming pattern:
```
[Section].[SubSection].[Stage].[Component].[Type].md
```

Example for this file: `3.0.Implementation.CodeGeneration.RazorPages.Prompt.md`

- **Section**: 3 (Implementation Phase)
- **SubSection**: 0 (Project Overview)
- **Stage**: Implementation
- **Component**: CodeGeneration
- **Type**: Prompt

**Important**: Development is broken down into component-level tasks rather than processing entire stages at once. Each agent works on specific components within a phase. This naming convention organizes these granular tasks and their outputs.

For example, the Implementation phase might include multiple component files:
- `3.1.Implementation.PageHandlers.RazorPages.Prompt.md`
- `3.2.Implementation.BusinessLogic.RazorPages.Prompt.md`
- `3.3.Implementation.DataAccess.RazorPages.Prompt.md`

- For Razor Page Models:
  - Implement handler methods (OnGet, OnPost, OnGetAsync, OnPostAsync, etc.)
  - Add proper model binding
  - Implement form validation
  - Add appropriate redirects and page navigation
  
- For .cshtml files:
  - Implement the UI with proper Tag Helpers
  - Add form elements with validation
  - Implement responsive layouts
  
- For Service classes:
  - Implement business logic
  - Add proper error handling
  - Ensure services follow dependency injection patterns
  
- For Repository/Data access:
  - Implement data access logic
  - Add proper exception handling
  - Ensure async patterns are used correctly

- Add appropriate comments for complex logic
- Implement proper dependency injection throughout the application
- Generate unit tests for page models and service classes
