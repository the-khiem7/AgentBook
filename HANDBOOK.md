# AgentBook Handbook

Use this handbook as a quick map to the root-level folders. Each section keeps prompts, playbooks, and operations material close to the workflows that need them.

## Agents
- `agents/core` - phase-by-phase prompts for the primary multi-agent workflow (planning through review)
- `agents/razor-pages` - specialized prompts tuned for ASP.NET Razor Pages projects

## Playbooks
- `playbooks/vitaflow` - VitaFlow delivery blueprint with phase roadmaps, prompts, guides, and scenarios

## Operations
- `operations` - task breakers, GitHub automation scripts, and agile pipeline guidance for day-to-day execution

## Platform
- `platform/github` - platform-specific configuration and Copilot collaboration instructions

Pair this handbook with `README.md` when you need a high-level process refresher.
