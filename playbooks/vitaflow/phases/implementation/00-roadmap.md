# Implementation Stage Roadmap

This document outlines the implementation strategy for the VitaFlow project, breaking down the process into manageable stages.

## Implementation Order

1. **Repository Layer** (3.1.Repository.Implement.Prompt.md)
   - Generic Repository Pattern implementation
   - Database access with EF Core + PostgreSQL
   - Unit of Work pattern
   - Base for all data operations

2. **Service Layer** (3.2.Services.Implement.Prompt.md)
   - Business logic implementation
   - Integration with Generic Repository
   - Cross-cutting concerns
   - Transaction management

3. **Page Models** (3.3.PageModels.Implement.Prompt.md)
   - Handler methods
   - Form validation
   - Service integration
   - User interaction flows

4. **UI Layer** (3.4.UI.Implement.Prompt.md)
   - Razor Pages implementation
   - Tailwind CSS integration
   - Responsive design
   - Client-side features

5. **Testing** (3.5.Testing.Implement.Prompt.md)
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - UI tests
   - Test infrastructure

## Implementation Process

1. Start with each prompt file
2. Implement the requirements step by step
3. Test each implementation before moving to the next
4. Document any decisions or deviations
5. Review and refactor as needed

## Benefits of This Approach

- Logical dependency flow
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable components
- Maintainable structure
- Progressive enhancement

## Next Steps

After each implementation stage is complete:
1. Review the implementation
2. Run tests
3. Document any issues
4. Move to the next stage
