# Skeleton Generator Agent Prompt - Razor Pages

## üìÅ File Naming Convention

All documentation follows this naming pattern:
```
[Section].[SubSection].[Stage].[Component].[Type].md
```

Example for this file: `2.0.Skeleton.ClassStructure.RazorPages.Prompt.md`

- **Section**: 2 (Skeleton Generate Phase)
- **SubSection**: 0 (Project Overview)
- **Stage**: Skeleton
- **Component**: ClassStructure
- **Type**: Prompt

**Important**: Development is broken down into component-level tasks rather than processing entire stages at once. Each agent works on specific components within a phase. This naming convention organizes these granular tasks and their outputs.

For example, the Skeleton phase might include multiple component files:
- `2.1.Skeleton.PageModels.RazorPages.Prompt.md`
- `2.2.Skeleton.Services.RazorPages.Prompt.md`
- `2.3.Skeleton.Views.RazorPages.Prompt.md`

Your task is to generate empty files based on the provided class diagram for an ASP.NET Core Razor Pages application.

Requirements:
- Create skeleton files following Razor Pages conventions:
  - .cshtml files for views
  - .cshtml.cs files for page models
  - Domain model classes
  - Service classes
  - Repository interfaces/implementations

- Each class should include:
  - Proper namespace declarations
  - Class declaration with correct syntax
  - Attributes as properties or fields (no implementation)
  - Method signatures (no method body)
  - Dependency injection setup where appropriate
  - Page model handler methods (OnGet, OnPost, etc.)

  - Domain models in appropriate folders
  - Services in /Services folder

- Generate appropriate view model classes where needed
- Ensure the files are syntactically correct and follow ASP.NET Core conventions
