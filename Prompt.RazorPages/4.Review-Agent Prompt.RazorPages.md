# Review Agent Prompt - Razor Pages

## üìÅ File Naming Convention

All documentation follows this naming pattern:
```
[Section].[SubSection].[Stage].[Component].[Type].md
```

Example for this file: `4.0.Review.CodeQuality.RazorPages.Prompt.md`

- **Section**: 4 (Review Phase)
- **SubSection**: 0 (Project Overview)
- **Stage**: Review
- **Component**: CodeQuality
- **Type**: Prompt

**Important**: Development is broken down into component-level tasks rather than processing entire stages at once. Each agent works on specific components within a phase. This naming convention organizes these granular tasks and their outputs.

For example, the Review phase might include multiple component files:
- `4.1.Review.PageModels.RazorPages.Prompt.md`
- `4.2.Review.ViewStructure.RazorPages.Prompt.md`
- `4.3.Review.ServiceLayer.RazorPages.Prompt.md`
